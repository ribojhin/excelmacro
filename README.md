# Edit an Excel file that contains macros for PHP
=======================
This PHP library allows you to modify an Excel file that contains macros without disabling them.
For most PHP projects, the library (https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet) allows you to manipulate Excel files.
However, when you modify an Excel file with macro (xlsm), the macros no longer work.
This PHP library will allow you to modify XLSM files without disabling macros.
The library only applies to Excel files with macros
